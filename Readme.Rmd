üé∫üíæ 

Bonjour! I'm a graduate student completing his master's of science degree in business intelligence and data science at HEC Montr√©al. I've helped bring multiple projects to life in the Qu√©bec creative and cultural world for the past few years. Up to August 2021, I was program manager at Zu Montreal, a creative hub for entertainment and technology. Music was my first love - I have a bachelor's in music from the University of Montreal (2014), and a master's in arts management from HEC Montreal (2016).  

Salut ! Je compl√®te actuellement ma ma√Ætrise en intelligence d'affaires/science des donn√©es √† HEC Montr√©al. Je compte traduire ce petit texte bient√¥t. 

## Recent projects:

### Social distancing calculator (WIP - 2021)

**Language & Packages: Python (mostly NumPy, Pygame)**

This is a heuristic algorithm that optimizes the capacity of a fixed-seat room with respect to social distancing. It ingests a set of 2D chair coordinates and numbers, and outputs a list of chairs to be occupied. Choosing the optimal number of chairs is an optimization problem. To focus on speed and simplicity, our heuristic strategy is that we loop a great number of times over a given algorithm, and select the run that produces the most chairs. This means we are pretty sure to approximate the best possible result, especially in smaller rooms. The algorithm works through a complete GUI with Pygame. NumPy arrays are also used for speed.

There are a few parameters to set, including : 

* The social distance to set between each chair (in metres)
* The number of iterations the algorithm should try 
* The maximum time the algorithm should run for (in minutes)
* The type of algorithm to use
  + The first algorithm divides a room into rectangular shapes, and then fills seats sequentially by starting from a corner
  + The second algorithm occupies a random seat first, then excludes its incompatible neighbours, and then starts again. Some finer parameters can be set to specify how the next chair should be chosen (at random, closest neighbour, weighed neighbour)

This group project was assembled for my class on algorithms for optimization and big data. Contributors:

### Hike Finder (2021)

<mark>**[Live version here](https://osimhan.shinyapps.io/hikeapp/)**</mark>

**Language & Packages: R (mostly Shiny, googlesheets4, googleway, dplyr)**

This is a proof of concept built in R and Shiny. It allows to choose a hiking trail in Quebec based on certain conditions, including driving distance. 

The biggest selling point of this tool is that it calculates your driving distance to all trails and lists the closest ones that match your filters. The Google autocomplete and geocoding APIs are used to standardize the address field and then transform it into a set of coordinates. The googleway package is then used to inferface with the goGgle maMs API, mostly to calculate driving distance. 

Authentification is done through a js.on file and an API key integrated in the main R file.

The code includes a few secret API keys and so is not immediately shareable, but I'm happy to share it on request.

### Book recommender system (WIP - 2021)

**Language & Packages: Python**

This project suggests new books to a user based on their previous ratings. 

We delved into the [Goobooks-10k](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k) dataset, that includes 6M individual reviews and 10 000 different books. The data was merged with additional tags present in the [Best books ever dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4265096#.YY2Zny3pPUI), that contains 50 000 books. Missing descriptions for 1800 books were then scraped through the Goodreads API, which bizarrely enough still works although it was announced in December 2020 it would be discontinued. The cleaned and agregated dataset will be released for public use soon.

A few strategies were applied to build efficient recommendations : 

- A baseline linear regression 
- Content-based filtering with NLP, using each book's description (about 800 characters)
- Collaborative filtering

Collaborators : 

- Yifan Yin
- Jingyi Zou

### Incubator stats : a simple dashboard for incubators (2021)

<mark>**[Live version here](https://osimhan.shinyapps.io/incubator_dashboard/)**</mark>

**Language & Packages: R (Shiny, ggplot2, dplyr)**

**Link to repo: https://github.com/malcolmosh/incubator_stats**

This dashboard displays a few simple metrics and graphs in a readable interface, with filtering options. The demo is [available here](https://osimhan.shinyapps.io/incubator_dashboard/). Artificial data was generated for this project and is stored in a [Google Sheets here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFewCMyHGIhMgSNVD6vfElNVoEvY_duGKipdkK97K0Q/edit?usp=sharing). 

Basically, this was an interesting foray into using Google Sheets as a flexible data source. Multiple graphs are generated with ggplot2. 

Note that the interface of this personal project is in French.

### Tangerinr : a R package for analysing banking data (2021)

**Language & Packages: R (tidyverse, ggplot2)**

**Link to repo: https://github.com/malcolmosh/tangerinr**

This is a functional but still limited R package that can be installed directly from Github. It can import debit statements from Tangerine Bank (Canada) located in a local folder, aggregate them, and then produce some simple visualizations. 

This project was completed for my class on statistical software.
